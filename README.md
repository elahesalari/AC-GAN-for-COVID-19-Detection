# Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved COVID-19 Detection

This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved Covid-19 Detection"**.  
The goal is to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy on CT images by augmenting the dataset with synthetic images generated by an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN).

## üö© Dataset

- **Source:** COVID and Non-COVID CT images  
- **Dataset link:** [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kVIe0HIYz_k9Jcjn27ViHPe51AG9y_fr?usp=sharings)  
- The dataset contains CT scan images of COVID-19 positive and negative patients.  
- Note: Multiple images per patient exist, and patient images must be strictly separated between training and testing sets.

## üìù Project Overview

This project is divided into **two main parts**:

### Part A ‚Äî COVID-19 Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

1. **Data Splitting**  
   - Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets  
   - Ensure no patient‚Äôs images appear in both sets

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Resize images to fit the input requirements of the network  
   - Normalize or apply other necessary image preprocessing

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a deep ConvNet classifier to distinguish between COVID and Non-COVID CT images  
   - Use VGG-16 pretrained models for feature extraction 

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Calculate precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC using scikit-learn  
   - Plot the ROC curve to visualize performance

### Part B ‚Äî Data Augmentation Using AC-GAN

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Repeat steps 1 and 2 from Part A

2. **AC-GAN Training**  
   - Train an Auxiliary Classifier GAN to generate labeled synthetic COVID and Non-COVID CT images  

3. **Augmented Data Evaluation**  
   - Test the ConvNet trained in Part A using only the synthetic images generated by AC-GAN  
   - Test the ConvNet using a combined test set consisting of 20% original test images plus generated images

4. **Visualization**  
   - Plot the ROC curve for results with augmented data
